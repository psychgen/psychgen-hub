In this section you can find information about how to export files to/from TSD. To export results from TSD please use the template included below.

## Exporting results from TSD

#### What is personal data?

Personal data is all information on the individual level. This is either results from completed analysis or raw data containing information on the individual. All group data with fewer than ten (\<10) individuals are considered personal data. Even personal data that is anonymised is considered personal data (this includes genetic data).

**Rule of thumb:** any line of data that is related to an individual is considered personal data.

#### Where to put the files you want to export on TSD

1.  Put the file(s) you need to export in `data/durable/common/Exported` files, within a folder with your name

2.  Write the date at the start of the filename or folder (if multiple files).

3.  Ensure that there are no individual-level data or results on groups of fewer than 10 (\<10) individuals in your file(s).
