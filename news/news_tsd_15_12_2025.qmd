If you receive a message about your TSD account expiring when trying to log in, don’t worry—this is a standard yearly security measure. Your password needs to be reset.

You will need to book a meeting time (approx. 15 minutes) to reset your TSD password. **Please check the Teams channel for further instructions.**
